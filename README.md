# Enrollment Management System

## Overview

This project is an Enrollment Management System developed for the purpose of On-the-Job Training (OJT). The system is designed using Java language with NetBeans as the development environment. While the backend, powered by MySQL Workbench, is not yet implemented, the frontend has been partially developed, with plans to continue the backend development when time allows.

## Features

The system includes the following forms:

1. **Login Form:**
   - Allows users to log in to the system. User credentials are stored in the User table.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Features a search field to query the database table for a list of students. It serves as a central hub for navigating the system.

3. **Course Form:**
   - Provides functionalities related to managing courses. The Course table is utilized, and the course information is used in a dropdown menu in other parts of the system.

4. **Teacher Form:**
   - Facilitates the management of teacher information. The Teacher table is utilized, and teacher details are used in dropdown menus, such as the student form.

5. **Student Form:**
   - Allows the entry and management of student details. The Student table stores comprehensive information about each student.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the Java source code files.
